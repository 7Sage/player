# Events

In this section, we'll look at the rich event system that's available when working with the player.

## Media Events

The media provider fires a superset of `HTMLMediaElement` events. You can kebab-case and prefix any
[native media event type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement#events)
with `vds-` to get the custom variant.

- `loadedmetadata` -> `vds-loaded-metadata`
- `canplay` -> `vds-can-play`
- `play` -> `vds-play`

Prefer our events as they smooth out any unexpected behaviour across browsers, attach additional
metadata to the event `detail`, and contain rich information such as the [request event](#request-events)
that triggered it or the origin event that kicked it off.

```js
const provider = document.querySelector('vds-video');

provider.addEventListener('vds-loaded-metadata', (event) => {
  // Original media event (`loadedmetadata`) is still available.
  const originalMediaEvent = event.triggerEvent;

  // Event detail contains goodies.
  const { currentSrc, duration, poster, mediaType } = event.detail;
});
```

You can find a list of all events fired by the provider in the API section of the respective
provider's documentation.

## Request Events

Request events are fired when 'requesting' the controller to update the provider's state. For example,
the `vds-play-request` event is a request to begin/resume playback, and as a consequence it'll
trigger a `play()` call. The provider should respond with a `vds-play` event to confirm the
request was satisfied.

```js
const media = document.querySelector('vds-media');
const provider = document.querySelector('vds-video');

media.addEventListener('vds-playâ€“request', () => {
  console.log('Play request was made.');
});

provider.addEventListener('vds-play', (event) => {
  // Request events are attached to media events.
  const playRequestEvent = event.requestEvent;
  console.log('Play request was satisfied.');
});

playButton.dispatchEvent('vds-play-request', { bubbles: true });
```

## Event Triggers

All events in the library keep a history of **trigger** events. They are stored as a
chain of events, where each event points to the event that came before it. The chain goes back
to the **origin event**, which is the event that started the chain.

```js
import { hasTriggerEvent } from '@vidstack/player';

const provider = document.querySelector('vds-video');

provider.addEventListener('vds-play', (event) => {
  // Was this triggered by an actual person?
  const userPlayed = event.isOriginTrusted;
});

provider.addEventListener('vds-playing', (event) => {
  // Is this resuming from buffering?
  if (hasTriggerEvent(event, 'vds-waiting')) {
    // ...
  }
});
```

Here's an example chain (each <- represents a call to `triggerEvent`):

`vds-playing` <- `playing` (native) <- `vds-play` <- `play` (native) <- `vds-play-request`
<- `pointerdown` (origin event) <- `null`.
