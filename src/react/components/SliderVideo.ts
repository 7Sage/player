the slider. The point at which they're hovering or dragging (`pointerValue`) is the preview
time position. The video will automatically be updated to match, so ensure it's of the same
length as the original.

ðŸ’¡ The following attributes are updated for your styling needs:

- `video-can-play`: Applied when the video is ready for playback.
- `video-error`: Applied when a media error has been encountered.

ðŸ’¡ The `canplay` and `error` events are re-dispatched by this element for you to listen to if
needed. */
